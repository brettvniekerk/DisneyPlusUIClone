# This is a clone of the old Disney Plus UI written with a full tech stack
This is a project that I built to practice and show understanding of full stack development. It is built with a variety of technologies, including **Redux** and **Firebase**.

## Tech Stack
This UI clone was built with **Typescript, React, and Redux** (with **Styled Components**) for the front end, with **Firebase**'s Firestore and Authentication services handling the back end database for movie information, and user authentication respectively. Source control was handled with **Git**.

## Goal
The goal of this project was to practice full stack development, including handling routes with **react-router-dom**, and database interaction with **Firebase**. I also used this project to practice other technologies such as **Redux** for state management, and **Styled Components** for a reduced codebase, and more modular components.

## Challenges
There were plenty of challenges with this project. For example, current UI recreations were built with outdated technology, specifically old **react-router-dom** and **Firebase** libraries. Therefore, I had to update the codebase to fit the newer releases of these technologies, which while time consuming, was a rewarding and educational experience. The addition of **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit** also taught me a lot about state management, and they are definitely libraries I will want to use for future projects (especially because of their awesome browser extensions). **Styled Components** were also something I had to learn, and it was definitely DEFINITELY rewarding, and I'm honestly considering refactoring all my codebases to use them because of how modular they are, and how much they reduce the size of the project. Lastly, learning about the back end in general was a challenge (as well as learning the structure and setup of **Firebase**), as I have mainly focused on the front end, but it was super rewarding, and full stack definitely appeals to me as an opportunity to learn more about and pursue.

## Hosting
The project is being hosted on Vercel @ https://disney-plus-js.vercel.app/ -- not all buttons in the header and details page work as it's mainly a UI clone, not a full recreation (and I don't have the rights to the movies either)
